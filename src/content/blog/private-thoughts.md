# Private Post

This is a **private post** that won't appear in the public blog listing.

## How It Works

To view this post, you need to enter the password: `mypassword`

This is useful for:

- **Draft posts** that aren't ready for public viewing
- **Personal notes** you want to keep semi-private
- **Content for specific audiences** that you share the link with

## Privacy Note

Keep in mind this is client-side password protection, so it's not suitable for truly sensitive content. It's more of a "soft gate" to keep casual visitors from seeing certain posts.

For truly private content, you should use proper authentication on the server side or keep the content completely offline.

## Use Cases

Some good use cases for private posts:

1. Work-in-progress drafts
2. Personal journal entries you might share with friends
3. Technical notes that need review before publishing
4. Experimental content you're not sure about yet
