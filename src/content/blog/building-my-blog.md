# Building My Personal Blog

Today I built this blog using **Astro** and deployed it to **Cloudflare Pages**. Here's how I did it!

## Why Astro?

Astro is perfect for content-focused websites because:

1. **Fast by default** - Ships zero JavaScript by default
2. **Great DX** - Easy to work with and understand
3. **Flexible** - Use any UI framework you want (or none!)
4. **Built for content** - Collections API is perfect for blog posts

## Key Features

I built in some key features that I wanted:

### Public and Private Posts

The blog supports both public and private posts:

- **Public posts** appear in the main blog feed
- **Private posts** are password-protected and don't appear in listings

This is great for drafts or personal notes that I might want to share with specific people.

### Simple Design

I kept the design minimal and clean. No distractions, just content.

### Easy to Deploy

Cloudflare Pages makes deployment super simple:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Cloudflare Pages
3. Done! Automatic deployments on every push

## The Tech Stack

- **Astro** - Static site generator
- **TypeScript** - For type safety
- **Markdown** - For writing posts
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Hosting and deployment

## Next Steps

Some things I want to add in the future:

- [ ] Tags and categories
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] RSS feed
- [ ] Comments system
- [ ] Dark mode

Stay tuned for updates!
